he Tic Tac Toe game application, developed in JavaFX, provides an interactive platform for players to engage in the classic game. The application presents a graphical user interface featuring a 3x3 grid where players take turns placing their markers (X or O) with the objective of achieving a winning pattern.

Upon initiation, the application prompts users to input their names, distinguishing Player X and Player O. The game interface displays the current player's turn and allows them to select an empty cell to place their marker.

The game logic ensures that it detects a win or a draw condition after each move, alerting players accordingly. Wins are determined by achieving a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal alignment of three identical markers. In the event of a draw, where all cells are filled without a win, the game announces a draw.

The application provides a seamless user experience with intuitive controls and informative alerts, enhancing the enjoyment of the classic Tic Tac Toe game.
